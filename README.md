# üìä MATLAB Signal Processing Scripts

This repository contains a collection of **MATLAB scripts** developed for practicing key concepts in **Digital Signal Processing (DSP)**. These scripts cover plotting discrete-time signals, performing transformations like shifting and scaling, and computing convolutions of different signal types.
